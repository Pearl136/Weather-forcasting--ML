 
The code generates a synthetic weather dataset with 10 sample entries (rows) and 5 attributes (columns) and saves it as a CSV file. The dataset includes weather-related features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and cloud cover.
*Code Breakdown:
Imports:
import pandas as pd: This imports the pandas library, which is used for data manipulation and handling tabular data.

*Creating the Sample Data:
A dictionary called sample_data is created with 5 key-value pairs. Each key represents a feature (e.g., Temperature, Humidity) and each value is a list of values representing the data for each of the 10 samples.

*Converting the Dictionary to a DataFrame:
pd.DataFrame(sample_data): This takes the sample_data dictionary and converts it into a DataFrame, which is a table-like structure used for organizing and manipulating data.

*Saving the DataFrame to a CSV File:
sample_df.to_csv("sample_weather_data.csv", index=False): This saves the DataFrame as a CSV file named sample_weather_data.csv in the current directory. The index=False ensures that the row numbers (indices) are not included in the CSV file.
